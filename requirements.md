Scope (Initial Version):
1. File Type
   - Only handle files with extension .marp (no .md fallback).
   - handle marp files using collection, don't hardcode the marp file path in the plugin

2. Routing
      Content routing & content collection integration:
      - Native Astro Content Collection support (built-in):
        * The integration support to query the collextions through Astro's standard content APIs (similar pattern to astro-typst).
        * Each deck entry exposes: id/slug, filePath, title (frontmatter title or first heading fallback), theme, slidesCount (computed), updatedAt (fs mtime), images (array of optimized image metadata), frontmatter (raw), and sourceHash (for cache/debug).
        * Slug derivation follows Astro's standard collection slug algorithm and the resulting slug is used for routing (relative to routeBase). (No separate "non-collection" slug mode is required since collection support is mandatory.)
      - Draft / exclude support (future): respect frontmatter draft: true to skip route emission (still queryable when explicitly requested if we mirror Astro's draft handling).
      - Incremental dev: adding/removing a .marp file immediately adds/removes the corresponding route and collection entry.

3. Transformation Pipeline (entry.render()-based)
   Instead of emitting a fully composed HTML file via a bespoke interface, each deck is represented as (a) a virtual module exporting the Marp-processed HTML fragment and metadata, and (b) an Astro page wrapper (internal template) that imports that virtual module. During both dev and build the integration relies on Astro's standard rendering flow by calling entry.render() for the generated page entry, ensuring:
   - Consistent asset injection, scripts, and head management identical to normal .astro pages.
   - No divergence in SSR/SSG behavior or future Astro optimizations.
   - Simplified maintenance (no parallel custom HTML emission path).
   The steps below (image collection, optimization, Marp CLI invocation) feed into this process; the final HTML seen by the browser is always the result of Astro's entry.render() output, not a manually assembled standalone artifact.
   - Read raw .marp file.
   - Parse & collect image references (Markdown image syntax, possibly inline HTML <img> baseline).
   - For each image:
     a. Resolve path (support relative to file and alias @ or src root if feasible).
     b. Use Astro image optimization (e.g., getImage / optimizedImage) to produce an optimized asset (respect user config: format, width set(s), quality).
     c. Replace original reference in the Markdown with the resulting optimized path or HTML tag (whichever preserves Marp compatibilityâ€”prefer keeping Markdown syntax with updated URL).
   - After rewriting image references, pipe the updated Markdown string into Marp CLI via stdin using:
       marp --stdin --theme <absolute-theme-path> -o -
     (Capture stdout as HTML.)
   - Emit final HTML into a virtual module / or build artifact integrated into the page route.


4. Themes
   - Built-in themes located at src/themes/*.scss within the integration package.
   - The plugin does NOT compile SCSS; it simply passes the absolute file path to Marp CLI's --theme argument.
   - Provide configuration:
       defaultTheme: 'am_blue.scss'
   - Validate theme existence at config time; throw helpful errors.

5. Developer Experience
   - HMR: On .marp changes, re-run pipeline and update served route.
   - Logging: Clear, namespaced (e.g., [astro-marp]) messages for:
       - Starting transform
       - Theme resolution
       - Image optimization counts
       - Marp CLI errors (surface stderr)
   - Error Handling:
       - Fail gracefully (do not crash dev server on single deck failure).
       - Show overlay with meaningful message.

6. Configuration Shape (MUST)
   marp({
        defaultTheme: 'am_blue',
   })

7. Lifecycle Integration (Astro API)
   - config:setup:
       addPageExtension('.marp')
       Inject virtual modules (e.g., virtual:astro-marp/<slug>)
       Optionally: addContentEntryType (if modeling decks as content entitiesâ€”stretch goal)
   - build:start / build:setup:
       Prepare output directories, warm theme resolution.
   - server:setup:
       File watcher for included glob.
   - build:done:
       Summarize number of decks processed.
   - (If needed) pre or post hooks to align with asset emission.

8. Virtual Modules
   - Purpose:
     This integration does NOT replace or hook into Astro's builtâ€‘in Markdown / MDX / MDC loaders. Instead, each .marp file is preprocessed (images rewritten + Marp CLI HTML generation) and then exposed to the rest of the Astro build via a lightweight virtual ESM module. This mirrors patterns used by other tool-driven integrations (e.g. astro-typst) where an external compiler owns the markup semantics.
   - Rationale / Best Practice Justification:
     * Keeps a clear separation: Astro handles routing, layouts, islands, asset graph; Marp handles slide semantics.
     * Avoids inventing a parallel page-emission pipeline (we still let Astro call entry.render()).
     * Enables HMR granularity: updating a .marp file only invalidates its virtual module, letting Astro re-render the wrapper page.
     * Encourages treeâ€‘shakable, typed exports instead of adâ€‘hoc string injection.
     * Matches established integration patterns (virtual: namespace, stable exported surface) and avoids depending on undocumented internal Markdown loaders.
   - Exported Interface (proposed minimal contract):
       export const html: string              // Final Marp-rendered HTML fragment (no surrounding <html> shell).
       export const meta: {
         id: string;                          // Internal unique id (e.g. relative path hash)
         slug: string;
         title: string;
         theme: string;
         slidesCount: number;
         filePath: string;                    // Absolute source path (for debugging; not for client use)
         updatedAt: string;                   // ISO timestamp
         sourceHash: string;                  // Hash of (normalizedSource + theme + imageConfig)
         images: Array<{
           original: string;                  // Original reference as written
           optimizedSrc: string;              // Public URL after Astro optimization
           width?: number;
           height?: number;
           format?: string;
           alt?: string;
         }>;
         frontmatter: Record<string, unknown>;
       };
       export const raw: string               // (Optional) The post-image-rewrite Markdown fed to Marp (for debugging or future features).
       export function getSlides(): string[]  // (Optional) Split html into individual slide HTML strings if slide-level embedding/UI is desired.
   - Why export html instead of an Astro component?
     Returning a plain string keeps the Marp output opaque and avoids attempting to re-parse or sanitize it through Astro's compiler (which is optimized for .astro/.mdx sources). The wrapper Astro page (internal template) is responsible for safe injection (e.g., set:html) and optional augmentation (navigation UI, embedding).
   - Alignment with astro-typst / internal patterns:
     Similar to astro-typst, we:
       * Provide a virtual import surface (virtual:astro-marp/...)
       * Keep the external tool's compiled artifact as a primitive (string or data object)
       * Let Astro's normal routing + layout system consume that artifact
     Unlike core Markdown/MDX (which flows through Astro's content/markdown pipeline), we explicitly bypass that because Marp introduces its own fenced directives, slide separators (---), and theme application logic that the native pipeline is not aware of.
   - Caching Hook:
     The sourceHash exported in meta allows higher layers (listing pages, client-side caches) to detect when a deckâ€™s transformed content truly changed vs. superficial timestamp modifications.
   - A generic Astro page template consumes this virtual module to render the final route (configurable or internal default).

9. Performance / Caching
   - Hash (content + theme + config image settings) to decide whether to re-run Marp CLI.
   - Store intermediate hashed results in .astro-marp-cache (configurable).
   - In dev: minimal caching, prefer fast re-run; in build: leverage full caching.

10. Security / Sandbox
    - Only allow local file theme references under approved directories (built-in).
    - Disallow remote theme URLs in MVP.

11. CLI Invocation Details
    - Use Node child_process.spawn (not exec) to stream stdout.
    - Command structure:
        marp
          --stdin
          --theme <abs-path-to-theme in the plugin>
          -o -
          --html

12. Output HTML Handling
   - The Marp-produced HTML fragment (html export) is injected into an internal Astro page template via set:html to preserve any Marp-generated structure (sections, slides, inline styles).
   - Mermaid Support:
     * To enable rendering of Mermaid diagrams contained in fenced code blocks (```mermaid ... ```), the integration injects a Mermaid initialization script tag into the <head> of Marp-produced HTML fragment (html export)
     * Injected snippet (exact form) into head of the html:
       <script type="module">
         import mermaid from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs";
         mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
       </script>
     * The script is appended in the head of the html
     * Future enhancement: allow disabling or customizing Mermaid initialization via config (e.g., mermaid: { enabled: false, init: {...} }).
   - Ordering:
     1. Astro head elements (site-wide)
     2. Theme stylesheet link(s) emitted by Marp
     3. Mermaid script injection (default action)
     4. Optional integration navigation script (future)
   - Sanitization / Safety:
     * The Marp HTML is treated as trusted output from the Marp CLI; no additional HTML re-writing is performed beyond the earlier image URL substitutions and Mermaid injection.
     * The Mermaid script source is a fixed, version-pinned HTTPS CDN URL.

13. Image Handling Specifics
   - Scope: Only local (project-resident) image assets are processed/optimized. Any image reference that resolves to a remote URL (starts with http:// or https://) is left exactly as written in the source Markdown (no rewriting, no optimization attempt).
   - Local Image Definition:
     * Relative paths
     * Absolute paths rooted in the project (e.g., /src/images/foo.png if we allow leading slash resolution) or alias-based (@/images/foo.png) when supported by the resolver.
   - Remote / Non-local Detection:
     * A reference is considered remote if the URL begins with: http://, https://, // (protocolâ€‘relative), or data:.
     * Remote + data URLs are passed through untouched (their alt text/title remain unchanged).
   - Processing Logic (per discovered Markdown image):
     1. Extract original target (rawTarget).
     2. If remote -> record in images array with original preserved and no optimizedSrc (or optimizedSrc === original) and skip further work.
     3. If local -> resolve to absolute filesystem path; validate existence.
     4. Run through Astro image optimization pipeline (respect configured formats / widths / quality).
     5. Replace only the URL segment in the Markdown image syntax with the optimized public URL (retain alt text + title).
   - Caching / Deduplication:
     * Only attempt optimization once per unique absolute file path per deck transform.
     * Maintain a map: absPath -> { optimizedSrc, width, height, format } reused for subsequent identical references.
   - Failure Handling:
     * Missing local file: log a warning [astro-marp] Missing image: <path> (left unmodified) and keep original reference (do NOT break the build).
     * Optimization error: warn and fall back to original reference.
   - Data URLs:
     * Treated like remote (no optimization). Large inline data URLs are discouraged; we may add a size warning in future versions.
   - Output Metadata (images array):
     * For remote/data URLs: original = optimizedSrc = as-authored; width/height/format likely undefined.
     * For local: original = as-authored reference; optimizedSrc = final emitted public path; include discovered/returned intrinsic dimensions when available.
   - Security / Integrity:
     * No fetching of remote images occurs (avoids build-time network variability and security concerns).
     * Only filesystem reads within the project root (and allowed alias dirs) are performed.
   - Rationale:
     * Keeps build deterministic and performant.
     * Avoids surprising network dependency or accidental leakage of credentials via private remote image hosts.
    - Recognize Markdown: ![alt](path "title")
    - Possibly support query params (e.g., image.png?w=800) but canonicalize through optimization pipeline.
    - Keep alt text intact.
    - Store mapping original -> optimized to avoid duplicate processing in same file.
    - Use relative public path for final substitution (ensuring it matches Astro's build output expectations).

14. Testing Strategy
   Manual Dev Smoke Test (parent test-astro-project):
   - Prereq: The integration is linked/installed in a parent test-astro-project
   - 1. Install & run: npm install (or pnpm install) then npm run dev.
   - 2. it has two collections in `src/content`, one is presentation(marp presentation) at `src/content/presentations`, one is posts(normal markdown files) at `src/content/posts`; the marp file should contain a local image reference
   - 3. each task implementation is done, immediately test it in this test project
   - 2. Terminal validation: Ensure startup prints no unexpected [astro-marp] errors or warnings. Acceptable logs: theme resolution, deck discovery counts.
   - 3. Open the deck: Navigate in a browser to http://localhost:<devPort>/presentations/macroeconomics.
   - 4. Browser console (chrome-devTools MCP tool and playwright mcp tool): Confirm zero runtime errors or warnings related to:
       * Failed network requests (theme CSS, mermaid script, images)
       * Uncaught exceptions (navigation, slide rendering)
   - 5. Slide navigation: Use ArrowRight repeatedly until the end, then ArrowLeft back to start.
       * Expect multiple slides.
       * If an onâ€‘screen indicator is absent, verify count by:
         a. Inspecting document.querySelectorAll('section') (Marp default) or
         b. Checking window.__MARp_META?.slidesCount (if exposed) or
         c. Counting pagination UI elements if present.
   - 6. Error capture: If any console error appears, record:
       * Complete console message + stack
       * Current slide index when it appeared
       * Whether reproduction requires specific navigation speed
   - 7. Regeneration check: Edit the .marp source (e.g., change a heading), save, watch for HMR update without full page crash; console should remain clean.
   - 8. Image verification: If the deck contains images, confirm that image URLs point to optimized (hashed) assets and that no 404s occur.
   - 9. Mermaid (if mermaid fences exist): Ensure mermaid initializes (no "mermaid is not defined" error) and diagrams render; failure should fall back to code block without throwing.
   - 10. Exit dev server cleanly (Ctrl+C) confirming no lingering child process warnings (Marp CLI should terminate).

   Automated testing Example (mandatory):
   - Launch dev server, launch in backroud, save the console logs to a file, and read that file to see the console logs
   - use playwright mcp tool to navigate the slides, swich between different slides
   - use chrome-devtools mcp tool to examine the pages
   - kill the process of the dev server, after that use `ps -ef |grep astro` to verify the dev server is stopped

   Acceptance for this manual section:
   - No terminal or browser console errors/warnings.
   - Route /presentations/macroeconomics is reachable.
   - Exactly all navigable slides via arrow keys.
   - Any encountered error is logged with reproduction details (slide index, message).
    - Unit: path resolution, theme selection, markdown image rewrite.
    - Integration: run dev server, add/change .marp file, expect updated route HTML.
    - Snapshot: final HTML vs known baseline (strip volatile attributes).
    - E2E: build project and confirm emitted routes + assets.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Installing the integration and adding a .marp file produces a routable slide deck in dev and build.
- Images inside the deck are optimized (confirmed via output file names / sizes).
- Changing an image or markdown triggers HMR rebuild of the deck page.
- Theme resolution errors are surfaced clearly.
- No reliance on npx at runtime.
- Works on Node LTS environments matching Astro support matrix.

Developer Implementation Notes:
- Keep integration code modular: themeResolver.ts, imageProcessor.ts, marpRunner.ts, routeGenerator.ts, cache.ts.
- Provide TypeScript types for public config.
- marp cli is a dependency of the plugin, when install this plugin, it will install marp cli
